                            <p>We all take unique walks through life. Viewed together, these walks weave a tapestry.  The joy, the pain, the remarkable, and the boring, which are sometimes all-important in a given moment, fade into beauty when taken together.</p> 
                            <p>This work shows the tapestry weaved by the walks of simple automata, a model of the tapestry we weave as humans. In viewing this work, one might achieve a sort of detachment from the individual agents.  If one would like, one might also achieve a sort of detachment from one’s own story, seeing it as just one of the many stories in the tapestry that we weave together.</p> 
                            <p>This sense of detachment, which allows one to see oneself as one might see another, can foster self-compassion. It can also help one see another as one sees oneself, fostering empathy. Finally, it shows the part we play in the collective picture, and our responsibility to care for ourselves, eachother, and the world we live in.</p>
                            <p>The automata choose their colors from a walk along the Upstate New York Erie Canal. For example, we see color from a cobalt canal lock, arctic blue piping under a thruway exit bridge, and a navy circle around “Empire State Trail.”  We see a salmon color from Guelder-rose berries, a fiery red from a fall Smooth Sumac leaf, and a golden ochre from a Willow branch. Colors are drawn also, sometimes, from a painted rock garden outside of a hospital.</p>

                            <p>In this work, the automata take center stage.  They have predetermined tendencies, but they are otherwise free. For example, large compositional shapes are not explicitly programmed; the automata are free to generate these shapes themselves.</p>  
                            <p>The principal algorithm, with some twists, is that the automata try to move straight, but not to retrace their own steps or the steps of others.</p>
                            <p>The automata often change location, color, size, and sometimes even the rule by which they move.  Some automata move according to complex and dynamic representations of distance.</p>

                            <p>I am interested in visualizing algorithms that involve automata.  I love to see how different automata interact. I am as inspired by reading fiction - for example, the interactions of Chekhov’s characters - as I am by studying data structures.</p>  
                            <p>Many have noted that complex behavior can emerge from automata following simple rules, and the goal of my research is to understand how these rules, under additional constraints, translate to a visual experience.</p>  
                            <p>I take a statistical perspective, because it allows for automata whose behavior can easily become complex.</p>

                              <p>I appreciate discussions and feedback from J Oh, A Park, K Vaden, M Pinney, and the ArtBlocks committee, among others. Recent influences are too many to mention; I was influenced early on by H Lippman, J Leonard, M Waltz, S Freek, T Hobbs, and my Mother, among others.</p>
